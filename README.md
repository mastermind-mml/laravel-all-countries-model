# laravel-all-countries-model
This script allows you to create a model with all countries and country details such as capital, zip, currency, language, etc by just copying this script and putting it in your countries model file in laravel. NB: Remember to change &lt;your model name> to your actual model name in your project to make it work. Also it uses uuid but you could change it to suit your project.. Enjoy!
